1
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,187
這才是去海邊的樣子
MacGYVER: Now, this is what goin' to the beach is all about.

2
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,824
( women shouting )

3
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,691
外面有幾個美女
Boy, there's some fine-lookin' women out there, huh?

4
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,980
-你有望遠鏡嗎？ -有, 在廚房
You got those binoculars?

5
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,999
Yeah, in the kitchen.

6
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,303
話說回來
MacGYVER: On the other hand,

7
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:49,988
我從不覺得拯救女將軍 是海灘樂趣

8
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,380
rescuin' a lady general

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,677
has never been my idea of beach fun.

10
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,197
( doorknob rattles )

11
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:31,796
好了

12
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:34,586
看看有什麼可用的
All right, let's see what we've got to work with.

13
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,703
這是好的開始
Okay, this seems to be a good start.

14
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:58,076
我只需要他們分心幾秒鐘
All I need is a few seconds of distraction.

15
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,410
老天, 你看看
Oh, man,

16
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,440
look at that!

17
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,536
（蔬菜油）

18
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,013
我一定要出去看看
Oh, I gotta go outside and check this out.

19
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:55,934
What the...?

20
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,037
我們走, 快點
Hey, let's go! Come on!

21
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,604
誰在裡面？

22
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,229
Who's in there?

23
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,064
Hey!

24
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,300
( grunting )

25
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,507
看來妳對他們 什麼都沒說吧, 將軍
I'll bet you didn't tell them a thing, huh, General?

26
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,772
我把妳弄出去吧
Let's get you outta here.

27
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,279
手銬, 可惡
Handcuffs! Damn!

28
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,621
( men grunting and shouting )

29
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,557
( grunting )

30
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,778
抓住他

31
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,769
她不見了
She's gone!

32
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,345
( both yell )

33
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,879
( grunting and gasping )

34
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:50,428
別動

35
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,900
坐下, 別動
Stay! Sit! Stay!

36
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:55,054
好狗狗
Good dogs.

37
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,706
派克曼, 我是馬蓋先
Yeah, Packman? MacGyver.

38
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,673
你失蹤的女將軍
You know that lady general you lost?

39
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:13,373
我找到她了
Well, I found her.

40
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,708
馬蓋先 第一季

41
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,790
目標馬蓋先

42
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:34,718
我真的得重新思考我的人生了
MacGYVER: I really have to rethink my life.

43
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:38,026
才把女將軍送回五角大廈
I hardly get the lady general back to the Pentagon

44
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:40,895
就接到紅色警戒的任務
when I get a Code Red priority.

45
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,801
所以我在這個月光照耀的夜晚
So, here I am on a moonlit night starin' down the throat

46
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:52,878
盯著這座全新的 中東核能精煉廠
of a brand-new Middle Eastern nuclear refining plant

47
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,674
它存在的原因不外乎
put on this good Earth for no other reason

48
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,020
就是要讓某個軍事狂人 炸掉他的鄰居
than to allow some crazy strong man

49
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,680
to blow up his neighbors.

50
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:07,949
猜猜華府要我做什麼
Guess what Washington asked me to do.

51
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,770
好, 準備好要炸了
All right, ready to blow it.

52
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,905
4點30分來接我
Be at the pickup zone at 0430.

53
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:44,851
好了
All right.

54
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,438
回到家了, 夠了就是夠了
Home-- enough is enough.

55
00:09:00,411 --> 00:09:04,448
我不會在任何條件下 為任何原因
I will not, under any circumstances

56
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,910
for any reason whatsoever answer the phone...

57
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:05,750
再接電話了

58
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,846
可能吧
probably... again.

59
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,313
沒錯, 我的確回到家了
Yes, I am definitely home.

60
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,902
什麼事？
Well?

61
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,708
我只是來恭喜你
I just dropped in to congratulate you.

62
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,112
非常謝謝你
Thank you very much.

63
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:20,511
部裡很感激
The Department is grateful.

64
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,812
不客氣
You're welcome.

65
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:24,713
我很累了
And I'm very tired.

66
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,585
我不是來派任務給你的
I'm not offering you an assignment.

67
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:28,125
我是來警告你
I'm giving you a warning.

68
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:29,429
你成了目標了
You're a target.

69
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:31,820
那你就要說清楚了
Now, that I'd like spelled out.

70
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:33,438
你把核能廠處理掉的時候

71
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,196
When you put away that nuclear installation, they ID'd you.

72
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:35,069
他們認出你了

73
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,163
第二天就放話出去
The contract went out the next day.

74
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,964
他們僱用了阿克斯特
They hired Axminster.

75
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,300
他殺了謝赫哈三, 對吧？
He took out Sheikh Hussein, didn't he?

76
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,035
就在禱告時
Right in the middle of prayers.

77
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,007
把他炸得當場上西天
Blew him straight to Allah

78
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:48,643
還順道殺了37個人
and killed 37 others along the way.

79
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,842
我們監看這裡的同時 你應該出城去
You oughta get out of town while we, uh, stake this place out.

80
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,780
巴尼, 我的麻煩 我喜歡自己處理
Barney, I like to take care of my own messes.

81
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,717
馬蓋先
MacGyver,

82
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,052
阿克斯特可以為了你 燒光整個街區
Axminster would torch the whole block just to get you.

83
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,866
我可以幫你 弄個安全無虞的住處
Now, I can set up a safe house, full security,

84
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:04,568
除非你自己有地方
unless, uh, you've got someplace

85
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,226
可以待上幾個星期
you'd like to settle in for a couple of weeks.

86
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,863
其實, 是有趟旅行
You know, there is a kind of a,

87
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,029
我想了一陣子了
a trip I've been toying with.

88
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,539
現在就去吧
Take it now.

89
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,337
只要是能讓你消失的
As long as it spells one word: "lost."

90
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,876
( sighs )

91
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,142
我想我的確該拜訪一個人
I guess I do owe a visit.

92
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,510
是誰？
To who?

93
00:11:25,023 --> 00:11:26,742
這是私事
It's personal, Barney.

94
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,750
好吧, 只要告訴我地點
Okay, just tell me if and where.

95
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,954
我會處理, 上校
I'll handle that, Colonel,

96
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,259
你不需要知道
and you don't need to know where.

97
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,093
你只要把阿克斯特處理好
You just take care of Axminster.

98
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,900
你看看這個
Take a look at this!

99
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:54,237
什麼？
What?

100
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:58,384
有個女人被外星人攻擊 還生了外星人寶寶
It says this here lady was attacked by aliens

101
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,844
and had an alien baby.

102
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,409
真的嗎？
No kiddin'?

103
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,922
對, 在阿拉巴馬州
Yeah. In Alabama somewhere.

104
00:12:04,028 --> 00:12:06,354
在那裡外星人是大事
Big on aliens in Alabama.

105
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,900
沒錯, 一堆怪人
No lie.

106
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,684
Full of strange people.

107
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,429
所以我才往北走
That's why I'm goin' North,

108
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:13,859
回去看看家人
back to see my family for a while.

109
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:16,924
有道理
Makes sense.

110
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,180
我十歲起就沒見過我外公了
MacGYVER: I hadn't seen my grandfather since I was ten.

111
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:25,537
他是我僅有的家人
He was all the family I had left,

112
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,705
而我們形同陌路
and we were strangers.

113
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:37,851
( phone ringing )

114
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:39,788
我是馬蓋先
MacGYVER: Hi. MacGyver here.

115
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,292
聽到嗶聲後 告訴我你在想什麼
When you hear the beep, let me know what's on your mind.

116
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,383
( beep )

117
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,726
我告訴你我在想什麼, 孩子
JACKSON: I'll let you know what's on my mind, bud.

118
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,770
把電話拿起來 我不喜歡跟機器說話

119
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,264
Pick up that phone and talk to me.

120
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,334
I got no mind for machines.

121
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,236
真是, 你大概不在家
Oh, damn, I guess you aren't there!

122
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,810
我是你的…
This is your...

123
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,650
我是哈利.傑克森
This is Harry Jackson.

124
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,972
The-the clerk from the general store

125
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:59,340
雜貨店的店員給我這個號碼
brung me up a note with this phone number.

126
00:12:59,183 --> 00:13:01,037
他說你要來看我
He says you're comin' to visit me.

127
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,345
阿克斯特
Axminster!

128
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,439
我只是想告訴你…
JACKSON: And I just want to say...

129
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,790
別過來, 我很忙

130
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:05,908
don't come.

131
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,383
I'm busy.

132
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,728
你大概已經在路上了
Ah, hell, you're probably on the way here already.

133
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,616
如果你又打去雜貨店
You can phone the general store again.

134
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,594
電話是303-555-7702
It's area code 303, triple-five, double-seven-oh-two.

135
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:19,558
我立刻去查
I'll try and run that down right away.

136
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:45,797
真是個美麗的地方
MacGYVER: What a beautiful part of the world.

137
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,370
什麼都有, 就是沒有人
Has everything but people.

138
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,227
我不明白我外公是怎麼了
I got to wonder what happened to my grandfather

139
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,027
為什麼決定這樣離群索居
that made him decide to live in such isolation.

140
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,772
事實上 我甚至懷疑他來不來接我

141
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:57,659
Actually, I wonder

142
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,635
if he'll even be here to meet me.

143
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,338
WOMAN: There he is...

144
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,805
WOMAN: Well, hop in.

145
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,120
你好, 哈利
Hi, Harry.

146
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,882
你怎麼知道？
How'd you know?

147
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:18,851
我是不會忘記外公的
I never forget a grandfather.

148
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:21,456
你長大了
You've grown.

149
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,257
已經過了16、17、18年了吧？
Well, it's been, what, six, 17, 18 years, hasn't it?

150
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:27,054
我沒注意
I hadn't noticed.

151
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,936
你沒收到我的留言 我想叫你別來

152
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,300
Didn't get my message to you.

153
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,163
I tried to head you off.

154
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,661
你介意我來嗎？
You mind that I came?

155
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,235
( bird squawking )

156
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,171
算了, 你人都到了
Ah, what the hell. You're here.

157
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,482
走吧, 我想在天黑前回到家

158
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:40,668
Well, come on.

159
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,713
I want to get home before dark.

160
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:44,245
車燈壞了
Headlights don't work.

161
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,242
你都沒變
You haven't changed.

162
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,346
沒必要, 我也沒打算要
Haven't had to, and I don't plan to.

163
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,407
好
All Right.

164
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,606
( seagull cawing )

165
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,220
好的

166
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,733
All right.

167
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,004
好
Okay.

168
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:14,443
謝謝
Thanks a lot.

169
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,319
號碼是在科羅拉多小鎮 烏雷的一家雜貨店

170
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,707
The number's a general store

171
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,375
in a little town in Colorado-- Ouray.

172
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,918
哈利.傑克森沒有電話
Harry Jackson doesn't have a phone,

173
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,390
但他們認識他 阿克斯特, 他們知道他住哪裡

174
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,053
but they know him, Axminster.

175
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,553
They know where he lives.

176
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,669
( truck thudding )

177
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,704
你是要摔死我 還是在嚇唬我
You trying to throw me or just scare me?

178
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,473
你老是喜歡聊天
You always did like to talk.

179
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,200
還是那麼強壯, 對吧？
Still tough as a dirty boot, aren't you?

180
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,744
一點都沒錯
You're damn right.

181
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,297
( door squeaking and closing )

182
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,235
怎麼樣
Well?

183
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,430
又濃又熱的黑咖啡, 是嗎
Black, hot and strong, right?

184
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,108
你都記得, 孩子
Nothin' wrong with your memory, bud.

185
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,577
外婆說過
Grandma used to say

186
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,954
除非咖啡濃到讓湯匙立著 否則你是不喝的

187
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,770
you'd never drink a cup of coffee

188
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,006
unless a spoon would stand up in it.

189
00:16:56,955 --> 00:17:00,253
你外婆從不放棄要我文雅些
Grandma never did give up trying to civilize me.

190
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,156
那也許是她唯一做過的蠢事

191
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,211
I guess maybe

192
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,550
that was the only dumb mistake she ever did make.

193
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,770
除了過世之外
Except maybe dyin'.

194
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,029
所以你才離開我們嗎？
Is that why you left us?

195
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,491
你總是一針見血
You always did get right to the point.

196
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,462
你還是一樣
Haven't changed.

197
00:17:18,076 --> 00:17:19,500
是變得不多
Not much.

198
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,334
要咖啡嗎？
Want coffee?

199
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,503
好
Yeah.

200
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,909
你還沒回答我
You didn't answer me.

201
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,508
我離開…
I left...

202
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,014
是因為時候到了
because it was time to leave.

203
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,782
不, 爸死的時候你還在
No, when Dad died, you were there.

204
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,413
你還在陪著我們
I mean, you were... you were there.

205
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,959
我是待了一陣子
I stayed around

206
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,148
for a while.

207
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,500
老天, 我有權過我自己的日子

208
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,351
God, for the love of Mike, boy,

209
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,825
I still had the right to my own life!

210
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,359
可惡, 哈利
Doggone it, Harry,

211
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,829
我介意的是…

212
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,809
你離開的方式
I guess maybe it's... how you did it.

213
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,202
某天早上我醒來, 你就不見了
I wake up one morning, and you're gone.

214
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:52,469
我不喜歡道別
I never liked good-byes.

215
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,948
我接了在阿拉斯加的一個工程

216
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,301
I

217
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,271
took a job workin'

218
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,842
in construction up in Alaska.

219
00:17:57,949 --> 00:17:59,203
好差事
Good job.

220
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,777
新地方
New country.

221
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,042
所以我去了
So I went.

222
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,810
我估計能定期寄錢…
I figured sending money regular would be more use

223
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,581
對你媽和你 會比我更有用
to you and your mother than I was.

224
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,848
那你估計錯了
You figured wrong.

225
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,530
你的床在那 要走要留隨便你

226
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,382
That's your bunk.

227
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,859
Leave or stay, it's up to you.

228
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,650
我們準備好出發了, 阿克斯特
We're ready to roll, Axminster.

229
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,781
( engines starting )

230
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,300
你想怎麼處理馬蓋先？
How do you want this guy MacGyver?

231
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,987
要死還是活的？
Dead or alive?

232
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:50,035
死
Dead.

233
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,646
( birds singing )

234
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,440
好吃
It's good.

235
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:34,565
你來做什麼？
Now, why are you here?

236
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,776
我只是不想再拖延來看你
I guess I just got past puttin' off this visit.

237
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,645
我好幾年沒想過家人了
I haven't thought about family in years.

238
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:50,955
現在也不怎麼想
Don't really want to now.

239
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,069
哈利, 你脾氣總是這麼硬嗎？
Harry, were you always this hard-nosed?

240
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,551
即便在我小的時候？
Even when I was a kid?

241
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,592
( sighs )

242
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:05,803
我記得這個
I remember this.

243
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,197
JACKSON: Uh...

244
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,741
這不是我十歲時 做給你的嗎
Didn't I make this for you when I was about ten?

245
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,580
你過生日還是什麼的
For your birthday or something?

246
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,544
( quacking )

247
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:17,171
很好用
It works good, too.

248
00:20:17,524 --> 00:20:18,981
最好的
Best I ever had.

249
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,353
小屋就在山脊上, 阿克斯特
CARSON: Cabin's at the top of the ridge, Axminster.

250
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:27,789
分兩路
Then spread out.

251
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:29,621
我們包抄小屋抓他們
We'll surround the cabin and hit 'em.

252
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:34,091
準備好要釣魚了嗎？
So, you ready for some fishin'?

253
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,409
我已經去過了 不然早餐怎麼會有魚

254
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,162
I already been.

255
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,532
What do you think we're havin' for breakfast?

256
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,830
拜託, 哈利
Come on, Harry.

257
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,880
是你告訴我 不是為了釣「魚」而「釣魚」

258
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,363
You're the one that used to tell me

259
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,600
you don't fish for fish, you fish for fishin'.

260
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,110
是純粹為「釣魚」而「釣魚」

261
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,503
房子是空的, 阿克斯特
CARSON: Cabin's empty, Axminster!

262
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,074
( birds singing )

263
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,613
真不錯
Nice.

264
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,439
是, 真的很棒
Yeah, it's real nice.

265
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:28,018
八年前發現這裡
Found this place about eight years ago.

266
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,081
我要待在這裡直到我死
I'm stayin' right here till I die.

267
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,121
你太固執, 不會死
Ah, you're too mean to die.

268
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,354
凡事皆有因果
What goes around comes around.

269
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,940
貨車還在, 他們一定在附近
BLACK: The truck's still here, Axminster.

270
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,365
They got to be close.

271
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:52,986
我跟媽在感恩節時最想你
You know, I think Mom and I missed you most

272
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,209
around Thanksgiving, Christmas.

273
00:21:53,052 --> 00:21:54,254
還有聖誕節

274
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,007
我記得你會帶我去砍樹
I remember you used to take me out to cut a tree.

275
00:21:57,991 --> 00:21:59,481
別煩了
Stop riding it!

276
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,460
我來這裡讓你那麼難受嗎？
Is my being here

277
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,776
that hard on you?

278
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:03,218
孩子
Bud,

279
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,646
這話題到此為止
subject is closed.

280
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,206
( fishing line creaking )

281
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,535
我釣到了
I got one.

282
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,208
我釣到了
I got one!

283
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,576
拉上來, 孩子, 小心
JACKSON: I said drag, bud. Watch it.

284
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,425
真不錯
Ah, that's a beaut!

285
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,530
晚餐, 別讓牠溜了

286
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,579
That's for dinner.

287
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,811
Don't let loose of him.

288
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:36,714
我不會讓牠溜了
I'm not gonna let loose of him.

289
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,100
拿網子來, 哈利
Get the net, Harry.

290
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:42,723
( gunshot )

291
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,970
搞什麼…

292
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,453
Hey, what the...?

293
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,551
( gunshots )

294
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,625
Aah!

295
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,199
( gunshots )

296
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,709
究竟怎麼回事？
What the hell is goin' on?

297
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,179
我等一下跟你說, 快
I'll tell you later. Come on.

298
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,276
你的朋友是誰？
Who are your friends?

299
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,073
哈利, 我沒想到他們會找到這裡
Harry, I didn't think they'd find me here.

300
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,890
他們可能很快就過來了
They'll probably be down here in a minute.

301
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:08,294
我們走
Let's go!

302
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:20,958
蘆葦？
JACKSON: Hollow reeds?

303
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,859
MacGYVER: Yeah. We'll make 'em think

304
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,560
對, 要讓他們以為 我們還在水裡
we're still out there in the water.

305
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,880
他們會識破的
They're too smart for that one, boy.

306
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,568
總是要試試
Got to try something.

307
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,039
如果他們真的中計呢, 孩子？
What if they do fall for this stunt of yours, bud?

308
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,379
對我們有什麼好處？
What do we get out of it?

309
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,080
拉開距離
Buy a little distance.

310
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,626
得看他們是否相信 我們躲在蘆葦下面呼吸

311
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,809
All depends on them believin' that it's us

312
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,781
breathin' under these reeds.

313
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,851
有點信心, 哈利
Have a little faith, Harry.

314
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,270
他們到底在哪？
AXMINSTER: Where the hell are they?

315
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,042
在那裡, 那些蘆葦
Down there, those reeds!

316
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:12,207
開槍
Fire!

317
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:16,954
( rapid gunfire )

318
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,920
你去看看
You, check it out.

319
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,774
被耍了
They tricked us.

320
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,169
什麼意思？
What are you talking about?

321
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,700
被馬蓋先設計了
MacGyver set us up.

322
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,171
我們去跟阿克斯特說
Let's go tell Axminster.

323
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:44,056
看來你的朋友在湖的對岸 找到那些蘆葦

324
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,441
Guess your friends found those reeds

325
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:43,946
over on the other side of the lake.

326
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:44,891
看吧

327
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,208
你孫子是有點本事的
See, your grandson's got something on the ball.

328
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,649
等一下, 哈利
Hold it, Harry.

329
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,170
這是蕁科植物, 很毒的
It's a plant from the Urtica family.

330
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,158
Strong stuff.

331
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,455
一點點在血液中
One dab in the bloodstream hits the neural system

332
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:59,052
就會影響神經系統 昏迷好幾個小時
and a guy's out for hours.

333
00:24:58,972 --> 00:25:00,290
吹箭？
Blow gun?

334
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:02,829
我就是在想那類的東西
I was thinking along those lines.

335
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:03,796
Ah.

336
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,414
哈利, 我們唯一的問題
The only problem we got, Harry,

337
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,798
要把他們擊昏, 得要射得準

338
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,378
in order for me to knock them out,

339
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,956
I'm gonna have to hit them just right.

340
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,418
正中頸子
Right in the neck.

341
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:30,637
要是射偏了呢？
What if you miss?

342
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,240
好, 給我
Okay, here we go.

343
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:11,092
現在吹箭有了
HARRY: Now we got a blow gun,

344
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,194
也許做些腳印 引他們找到我們
maybe help to make kind of a trail for them to track us.

345
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,960
等一下, 他們的足跡通往小溪

346
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,376
BLACK: Hold it.

347
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,277
Their trail leads down to the stream.

348
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,090
怎麼回事？
Hey, what's the matter?

349
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,063
Hey, hey, what's...?

350
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,610
怎麼…

351
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,498
( grunting )

352
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,268
( yells )

353
00:26:58,091 --> 00:26:59,214
做得好
Nice.

354
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,350
要正中目標才對
Gotta hit them just right.

355
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,100
哈利, 我們能從這走嗎？
Harry, can we get out this way?

356
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,619
看來我們沒有選擇
Don't seem to have a lot of choice.

357
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,655
是沒有
No.

358
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,200
等一下
Hold it!

359
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,666
Hold it right there, bud.

360
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,780
等等, 孩子, 你停不停啊？

361
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,798
Will you stop?

362
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,440
現在給我停下來！
Now wait a minute!

363
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:27,334
我說別走
I said hold it right there!

364
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,779
你是做什麼的, 孩子？
Who are you, bud?

365
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:32,038
這究竟是怎麼回事？
Now what the devil's all this about?

366
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:34,517
我沒得到答案是不會走的
I ain't moving until I get an answer.

367
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,480
抱歉, 哈利, 我不該來的
I'm sorry, Harry.

368
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,016
I shouldn't have come.

369
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,950
我低估了一些事情
I underestimated some things.

370
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,585
回答我的問題就好
Just answer the question.

371
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,770
這跟自由與和平有關, 哈利

372
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:47,255
It has to do

373
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,925
with freedom and peace, Harry.

374
00:27:50,728 --> 00:27:53,531
而有些人兩者都不喜歡
And some people who don't like either.

375
00:27:57,201 --> 00:28:00,546
我希望這值得那尾溜掉的鱒魚

376
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,342
Well, I sure hope

377
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,604
it's worth losing that damn trout.

378
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,610
他們還活著, 阿克斯特
They're still alive, Axminster.

379
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,447
-要把他們拉上來嗎？ -別管了

380
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,482
Shall we pick them up?

381
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,485
AXMINSTER: Forget them.

382
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:11,816
走吧
Move it.

383
00:28:13,284 --> 00:28:15,083
有正事要辦
We got a job to do.

384
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,492
附近有林務站嗎？
Is there a ranger station around?

385
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,870
還是林火瞭望台、農場什麼的

386
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,560
How about a fire lookout,

387
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,930
a ranch, anything?

388
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,660
我想想, 艾福莫

389
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,233
Ah, let's see.

390
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,635
Evermore, uh, it's a little,

391
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,367
是個鳥不生蛋的小鎮
old nothing town, uh, half dead.

392
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,204
會有電話線路
Well, now they got a phone line.

393
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,242
有多遠？
How far is it?

394
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,209
10至12哩吧
Oh, it's ten to 12 miles.

395
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,579
在高地沙漠區
It's up in the high desert.

396
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,804
好, 我們走
All right. Let's move.

397
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,210
走那邊 我們會繞過山丘跟你會合

398
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,018
AXMINSTER: Go that way.

399
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,451
We'll swing around the hill and meet you.

400
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:44,613
好
CARSON: Right.

401
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,620
打從兩年前被灰熊追之後…

402
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,650
HARRY: Haven't done this much running

403
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,127
就沒這麼跑過了
since two winters ago when a grizzly was chasing me.

404
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:53,855
牠有抓到你嗎？
Did he catch you?

405
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,228
沒有, 牠追鵟追累了
HARRY: Nah, got tired trying to catch an old buzzard.

406
00:28:56,561 --> 00:28:59,264
你在做什麼？停下來撿石頭？

407
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:57,927
Hey, what are you doing now?

408
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,331
Stop to collect rocks?

409
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,502
也許是那邊
CARSON: Maybe up that way.

410
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,778
好, 把他們逼出來
AXMINSTER: Okay, we'll flush them out.

411
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:10,739
看到什麼了嗎？
See anything?

412
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,576
我看到很多東西
MacGYVER: Oh, I see a lot of things.

413
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,620
有什麼是我感興趣的嗎？
Anything I'd be interested in?

414
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,780
有

415
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,853
兩輛吉普車分開
Yeah. Two jeeps splitting up.

416
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,480
其中一輛往這邊來了 但還要一陣子才會到

417
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,181
Only one's heading our way,

418
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:19,984
but he's gonna be

419
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,452
我想我們還有點時間
a while getting here, so I figure we got a little time.

420
00:29:22,453 --> 00:29:23,616
做什麼？
To do what?

421
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,720
哈利

422
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,724
你忘了教過我 怎麼誘捕動物了嗎？
Harry, don't you remember teaching me all about decoys?

423
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,031
把這個裝滿樹枝如何？
Why don't you fill that up with branches?

424
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,536
對, 弄個假人
Oh, yeah, and make it look like a man.

425
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,368
我來看看能否 用這棵樹玩幾招
Now let's see if I can get this tree to do a few tricks.

426
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,482
沒看到他們往這邊來
AXMINSTER: No sign of them coming this way.

427
00:29:50,548 --> 00:29:51,885
要繼續開嗎？
CARSON: Should I keep going?

428
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,618
我們該搞懂馬蓋先
AXMINSTER: We should figure out MacGyver.

429
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,590
再做決定
Then make a decision.

430
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,960
艾法、柯林、貝克, 聽到嗎？
Alpha, Colin, Baker,

431
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,464
do you read?

432
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,430
這是阿克斯特, 看到目標了嗎

433
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,462
This is Axminster.

434
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,659
Are targets in sight?

435
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,931
沒有
No, sir.

436
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,329
沒關係

437
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,129
反正是貓捉老鼠, 繼續走
No problem, it's just a little cat and mouse. Keep moving.

438
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,297
你們聽到命令了, 通話結束
You got your orders. Over and out.

439
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,036
好了嗎？
Okay?

440
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:13,076
往高地去
Head up to high ground.

441
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,275
對, 今天很適合打獵
AXMINSTER: Yeah, it's a nice day for hunting.

442
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,998
哈利？
Hey, Harry?

443
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,339
記得你以前告訴我 印第安人是怎麼作戰的嗎？

444
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,159
Remember you used to tell me about

445
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,533
how the Indians fought this way?

446
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,401
孩子
Bud...

447
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:47,539
我過去跟你說的很多事情

448
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,106
a lot of that stuff

449
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,977
I used to tell you is, uh, is stories.

450
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,015
都是故事而已

451
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,315
對, 不過很多都管用, 哈利
Yeah, well, a lot of it works, Harry.

452
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,484
( Jeep approaching )

453
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:10,626
( yelling )

454
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,010
可惡
Damn.

455
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,106
我還以為至少有車可以用了
Thought we'd at least get a free ride out of this.

456
00:31:19,037 --> 00:31:20,746
看來得繼續跑了
Guess we keep on running.

457
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,411
那是阿克斯特, 快走
MacGYVER: That's Axminster. Let's get going.

458
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,360
阿克斯特 另一輛車掉到山坑裡了
BLACK: Axminster, the other jeep, down in the gully.

459
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,470
又兩個受傷 我們去把馬蓋先解決掉

460
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,629
AXMINSTER: Two more down.

461
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,534
Let's finish this MacGyver now.

462
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,506
我頭昏眼花了, 孩子
You getting lightheaded, bud?

463
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,544
松果？
Pinecones?

464
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,417
沒錯, 哈利
Sure, Harry.

465
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,414
試過丟一個到火裡…
Don't you remember ever throwing one in a fire?

466
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,853
會怎麼樣嗎？
What happens?

467
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,221
會炸開來
It kind of explodes.

468
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:10,826
沒錯
Yeah, that's right.

469
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,954
加點松脂, 就能做地雷了
Add a little pine pitch and you got the makings of a landmine.

470
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:19,694
大自然很偉大吧
Ain't Mother Nature grand?

471
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,240
你是要躲開他們 還是有什麼主意了？

472
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:31,945
HARRY: You just trying to stay above them

473
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,348
or you got some kind of an idea?

474
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,714
兩者都有
A little of both.

475
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,982
我可以的
No, I can manage!

476
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,397
等一下, 哈利
Hold it, Harry.

477
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,167
我想吉普車會從那裡…
I figure the Jeep'll come from there

478
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:54,899
往這裡來
right through here.

479
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,470
你在…
Well, what in the...?

480
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,844
該埋地雷了
Time to bury the landmine.

481
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,014
看到什麼了嗎？
HARRY: See something?

482
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,187
沒有, 但我聽到聲音了
MacGYVER: Nope, but I hear something.

483
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,899
該走了
HARRY: Ought to get a move on.

484
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
時間多得是
Ah, there's plenty of time.

485
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:24,666
你確定會成功？
You sure that'll work?

486
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,131
不
Nope.

487
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,666
孩子, 你還真會安慰人
Bud, you are a comfort.

488
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,601
他們來了
HARRY: Here they come.

489
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,544
快, 我們走
Come on, let's go.

490
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,650
我小時候會把松脂當口香糖

491
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,947
When I was a kid, I used to chew

492
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,082
pine pitch like it was gum.

493
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,590
味道還可以

494
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:52,490
It tasted all right, but it burned a lot better.

495
00:33:49,955 --> 00:33:51,656
拿來燒更好

496
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:57,802
好

497
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,435
All right.

498
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,568
( rapid gunfire )

499
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,413
( grunting )

500
00:34:17,616 --> 00:34:19,115
哈利？
Harry?

501
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:20,990
我沒事
I'm all right.

502
00:34:21,286 --> 00:34:22,653
丟過去
Get him!

503
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,758
( yelling )

504
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,396
來吧, 哈利, 我們快走
Come on, Harry, let's get moving.

505
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,838
大家還好嗎？
AXMINSTER: Can anybody still move?

506
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,835
夠好到能抓馬蓋先了
CARSON: Yeah, good enough to find MacGyver.

507
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,535
看來我們也得走路了
BLACK: Looks like we're walking now, too.

508
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,640
不是走, 是跑
AXMINSTER: Not walk, run.

509
00:34:45,443 --> 00:34:47,445
要他進黃泉
We'll run him right into the ground.

510
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:57,759
不要緊的
Well, that's okay.

511
00:34:57,856 --> 00:34:59,426
只是小傷
I'm just dinged.

512
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,088
我注意到了
Yeah, so I noticed.

513
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,801
只是擦傷, 哈利
Just grazed you, Harry.

514
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,230
有可能更糟
Could've been worse, you know.

515
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:10,331
痛起來像很嚴重
Eh, hurts like worse.

516
00:35:10,669 --> 00:35:12,341
放在裡面
Put that inside.

517
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,944
用力壓住
Put pressure on it.

518
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:16,279
你還好嗎？
You all right?

519
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:34,126
我們到了
We made it.

520
00:35:35,794 --> 00:35:37,161
對
Yeah.

521
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,333
嘿…
HARRY: Hey!

522
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,708
所以…這就是艾福莫
MacGYVER: So... this is Evermore.

523
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,741
( coughs )

524
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,771
哈利

525
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,369
Harry, when was the last time you were here?

526
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,910
你上次來這裡是什麼時候？

527
00:35:51,576 --> 00:35:52,910
太久了
Too long ago.

528
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:55,484
是個死城了
It's dead.

529
00:35:56,414 --> 00:35:58,450
我猜我們也是
I guess we are, too.

530
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,920
哈利…
Harry? Harry! Harry!

531
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:12,226
該死的阿克斯特
Damn you, Axminster.

532
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:22,543
所以我倆在這鬼城
So, there we were in a ghost town, Harry and me.

533
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,315
哈利和我

534
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,216
我盡可能讓他舒服些
I tried to make him as comfortable as possible.

535
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,988
你在做什麼, 孩子？
What are you trying, bud?

536
00:36:32,158 --> 00:36:33,820
那是愚人金
That's fool's gold.

537
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:35,495
有黃鐵礦

538
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:34,815
Which contains

539
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,656
pyrite-- iron sulfide.

540
00:36:35,895 --> 00:36:37,097
硫化鐵

541
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:41,800
加點黏土混合起來 像是天然抗生素

542
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,294
Mixing it up with a little clay here

543
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,059
kind of makes a natural antibiotic.

544
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:44,095
看看你的傷怎麼樣了
Let's see what you got here.

545
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,934
你到底是做什麼的, 孩子？
Just what is it that you do, bud?

546
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,706
一點這個, 一點那個
Well, a little of this, a little of that.

547
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,876
( groans softly )

548
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,190
那麼…

549
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:04,814
Well, that... that sure explains it.

550
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:04,391
那就難怪了

551
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,049
你會沒事的, 哈利
You're going to be okay, Harry.

552
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,894
有想過掛個招牌當巫醫嗎？

553
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,284
Ever think of hanging out a shingle

554
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,326
as a medicine man?

555
00:37:18,138 --> 00:37:19,736
我有話要說
I've got something to say.

556
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,137
我一直在躲你
I've avoided you.

557
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:26,976
知道為什麼嗎？
You know why?

558
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,443
我媽
Mom.

559
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:34,907
先是你外婆
First your grandmother.

560
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,523
然後是你媽
Then your mom.

561
00:37:39,893 --> 00:37:42,115
當老天爺把她們帶走
When the good Lord took them,

562
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,727
我很傷心
I hurt.

563
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,400
我不願想起, 所以我…

564
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,089
I didn't want to be reminded,

565
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:54,138
so I just, uh, I just kept moving.

566
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:52,939
我就離開了

567
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,032
看到你…
Seeing you...

568
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,610
我很想你, 孩子
I've missed you, bud.

569
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:07,874
真可怕
Something terrible.

570
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:10,243
哈利
( softly ): Harry...

571
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,584
( sighing )

572
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:19,157
這真是很可悲的一幕
Well, that... sure was a sorry sight.

573
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,127
( sniffling )

574
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:21,323
夠了
Hey.

575
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,240
不准你說我外公壞話, 知道嗎

576
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:22,790
Don't you

577
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,460
ever badmouth my grandpa, you hear?

578
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,194
( chuckling )

579
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,862
( groaning )

580
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:33,545
我要找些東西來跟他們對抗 你說呢？

581
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,139
Look, I'm going to try and find some things

582
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,300
for us to fight with.

583
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,741
What do you say?

584
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,850
你真的認為 他們會找到這裡？
You really think they're going to find us here?

585
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,819
他們是職業殺手, 哈利
They're professionals, Harry.

586
00:38:44,257 --> 00:38:45,990
他們會找到我們的
They'll find us.

587
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,970
哈利好好地休息了一晚

588
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,098
Harry had a good night's rest, but I didn't sleep at all.

589
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,671
但我完全沒睡

590
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,210
我知道天一亮 阿克斯特就會開始追蹤我們

591
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,236
I knew that, with first light,

592
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,329
Axminster would be tracking us again.

593
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:07,614
所以我得在那之前 做最好的防備
So, I had to build the best defense I could

594
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,273
before they got to us.

595
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,982
孩子
Hey, bud!

596
00:39:15,322 --> 00:39:16,886
你在做什麼呢？
Mind telling me what you're doing?

597
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,784
我找到一些穀物屑
Yeah, found some grain dust.

598
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:21,595
好好利用就可以做很好的炸彈

599
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:19,915
Treat it right,

600
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,254
we got the makings of a pretty good bomb,

601
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,418
我確定
I'll betcha.

602
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,629
效果可能不錯
Might work good.

603
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:29,467
再弄點玄虛引他們來到 要爆炸的地方

604
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,195
Got a little parlor trick

605
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,322
to get them to come up close to where the explosion happens.

606
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,370
有時榖倉裡的穀物屑會爆炸
Sometimes you hear about floating grain dust

607
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,205
exploding inside a silo.

608
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:38,639
那叫自燃
It's called spontaneous combustion.

609
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:41,702
我則是刻意的
I'm going to do it on purpose.

610
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,339
而我發現哈利真是個好搭檔
And I found a real handy partner in Harry.

611
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,650
他想法就跟我一樣
He seemed to be talking just the way I was.

612
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,519
或說我的想法一直像他一樣
Or maybe I'd been thinking like him all along.

613
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,190
你的大爆炸只有一次機會, 孩子

614
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,644
HARRY: Only get one shot

615
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,190
with your exploding gadget, bud.

616
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,182
你有什麼打算, 哈利？
MacCGYVER: What you got in mind, Harry?

617
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,985
聲東擊西引他們過來
HARRY: A little remote control distraction.

618
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:03,330
保證讓那些呆子來這裡 收到大驚喜

619
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,590
Guaranteed to get them galoots

620
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,724
to come up real close for the big surprise.

621
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,826
孩子, 我從這裡可以像魔術師一樣
Hey, bud, I can play magician from over here!

622
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,009
忽隱忽現

623
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,132
Now you see it, now you don't-- and boom!

624
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:08,840
然後爆炸

625
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,341
好了, 這樣夠了
All right, that's enough.

626
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,520
已經在搖了 我可不想它倒在我頭上

627
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:22,009
It's shaking,

628
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,643
and I don't want it falling on my head.

629
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,930
訣竅是要讓那些呆瓜就定位

630
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,846
Real trick's going to be

631
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,388
getting those galoots in position.

632
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,659
如果他們不站在正下方 就行不通了

633
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,354
MacGYVER: If they aren't

634
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,823
right underneath it, it won't work.

635
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,722
你要去哪？
Where are you going?

636
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,562
過來, 我也有一招

637
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:30,555
HARRY: Come on.

638
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,151
I got a trick of my own.

639
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,889
這是什麼？松子？
What do you got, pine nuts?

640
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:38,071
我小時候會拿來玩
HARRY: Yeah, I used to have fun with them

641
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,995
when I was a kid.

642
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:39,473
把它們丟到火裡

643
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:39,933
I'd, uh, drop them in the fire,

644
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,335
看大家跳來跳去, 松子會爆開
and watch everybody jump, and they'd crack,

645
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,406
就像子彈一樣
and they'd go off like gunshots.

646
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,550
他們一直被你騙倒

647
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:47,639
Well, they've been falling

648
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,541
for your foolishness.

649
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,915
我想也來試試我自己的
I figured I'd try some of my own.

650
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:54,516
我想哈利開始喜歡這遊戲了
I think Harry was beginning to enjoy the game.

651
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,987
然而時間到了
And that's all the time we had.

652
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,574
( clanking )

653
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,522
( men yelling )

654
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,380
( loud popping )

655
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,646
( loud popping )

656
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,824
( man grunts )

657
00:43:22,235 --> 00:43:23,857
逮到他了
Got him good.

658
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,340
是啊
Yeah.

659
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,816
還有阿克斯特
We still have Axminster.

660
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,521
不過這次我們佔優勢了
Only this time, we got the odds.

661
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:45,213
對
Yeah.

662
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,460
Ow!

663
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,724
( grunting )

664
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:57,701
( gun cocking )

665
00:43:58,602 --> 00:43:59,967
( gunshot )

666
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,074
再過去一點, 孩子
Try, try to move him over, bud.

667
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,904
( grunting )

668
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,290
就是現在, 孩子
Now, bud!

669
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,415
( yelling )

670
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,554
你還好嗎, 孩子？
You all right, bud?

671
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,227
我好得很, 哈利
I'm more than all right, Harry.

672
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,929
( groans )

673
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,495
Whew!

674
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,670
( both laugh )

675
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,069
你有打算要再來嗎？
You figuring on coming back this way?

676
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,305
一定會的
Count on it.

677
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:45,547
我會期待的
I'll look forward to it.

678
00:44:46,286 --> 00:44:47,714
我也是
Me, too.

679
00:45:08,475 --> 00:45:09,934
哈利
Hey, Harry...

680
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,909
你要抓到那尾鱒魚, 好嗎？
catch that big old trout, will you?

681
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,472
一定會的
Count on it.

682
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,408
好好保重, 孩子
Take care of yourself, bud.
