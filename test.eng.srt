1
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:25,187
MacGYVER:
Now, this is what goin'
to the beach is all about.

2
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,824
( women shouting )

3
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:36,691
Boy, there's some
fine-lookin' women
out there, huh?

4
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,197
You got those binoculars?

5
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,999
Yeah, in the kitchen.

6
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,303
MacGYVER:
On the other hand,

7
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,380
rescuin' a lady general

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,677
has never been
my idea of beach fun.

9
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,197
( doorknob rattles )

10
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:34,586
All right, let's see
what we've got to work with.

11
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,703
Okay, this seems
to be a good start.

12
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,076
All I need is a few seconds
of distraction.

13
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,539
Oh, man,

14
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,440
look at that!

15
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,013
Oh, I gotta go outside
and check this out.

16
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:55,934
What the...?

17
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,002
Hey, let's go!
Come on!

18
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,229
Who's in there?

19
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,064
Hey!

20
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,300
( grunting )

21
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,507
I'll bet you didn't tell them
a thing, huh, General?

22
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,772
Let's get you outta here.

23
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,279
Handcuffs! Damn!

24
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,621
( men grunting and shouting )

25
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,557
( grunting )

26
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,769
She's gone!

27
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,345
( both yell )

28
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,879
( grunting and gasping )

29
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,782
Stay! Sit! Stay!

30
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,054
Good dogs.

31
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,706
Yeah, Packman? MacGyver.

32
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,673
You know that lady general
you lost?

33
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,373
Well, I found her.

34
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,718
MacGYVER:
I really have
to rethink my life.

35
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,026
I hardly get the lady general
back to the Pentagon

36
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,895
when I get a Code Red priority.

37
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:49,801
So, here I am on a moonlit
night starin' down the throat

38
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,878
of a brand-new Middle Eastern
nuclear refining plant

39
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,674
put on this good Earth
for no other reason

40
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,772
than to allow
some crazy strong man

41
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,680
to blow up his neighbors.

42
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,949
Guess what Washington
asked me to do.

43
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,770
All right, ready to blow it.

44
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,905
Be at the pickup zone at 0430.

45
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,851
All right.

46
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,438
Home-- enough is enough.

47
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,872
I will not,
under any circumstances

48
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,910
for any reason whatsoever
answer the phone...

49
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,846
probably... again.

50
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,313
Yes, I am definitely home.

51
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:12,902
Well?

52
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,708
I just dropped in
to congratulate you.

53
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,112
Thank you very much.

54
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,511
The Department
is grateful.

55
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,812
You're welcome.

56
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,713
And I'm very tired.

57
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,585
I'm not offering you
an assignment.

58
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,125
I'm giving you a warning.

59
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,251
You're a target.

60
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,820
Now, that I'd like
spelled out.

61
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,196
When you put away that
nuclear installation,
they ID'd you.

62
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,163
The contract went out
the next day.

63
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,964
They hired Axminster.

64
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,300
He took out Sheikh Hussein,
didn't he?

65
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,035
Right in the middle of prayers.

66
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,007
Blew him straight to Allah

67
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,643
and killed 37 others
along the way.

68
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,842
You oughta get out of town while
we, uh, stake this place out.

69
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,780
Barney, I like
to take care of my own messes.

70
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:55,717
MacGyver,

71
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,052
Axminster would torch
the whole block just to get you.

72
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,760
Now, I can set
up a safe house,
full security,

73
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,428
unless, uh,
you've got someplace

74
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,226
you'd like to settle in
for a couple of weeks.

75
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,863
You know, there
is a kind of a,

76
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,029
a trip I've been toying with.

77
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,539
Take it now.

78
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,337
As long as it spells one word:
"lost."

79
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,876
( sighs )

80
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,142
I guess I do owe a visit.

81
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,510
To who?

82
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,742
It's personal, Barney.

83
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,750
Okay, just tell me if and where.

84
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,954
I'll handle that, Colonel,

85
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,259
and you don't need
to know where.

86
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,093
You just take care of Axminster.

87
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,900
Take a look at this!

88
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,237
What?

89
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,541
It says this here lady
was attacked by aliens

90
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,844
and had an alien baby.

91
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,409
No kiddin'?

92
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,714
Yeah. In Alabama somewhere.

93
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,354
Big on aliens
in Alabama.

94
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,048
No lie.

95
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,684
Full of strange people.

96
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,429
That's why I'm goin' North,

97
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,859
back to see my family
for a while.

98
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:16,924
Makes sense.

99
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,074
MacGYVER:
I hadn't seen my grandfather
since I was ten.

100
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,537
He was all the family
I had left,

101
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,705
and we were strangers.

102
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:37,851
( phone ringing )

103
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,788
MacGYVER:
Hi. MacGyver here.

104
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,292
When you hear the beep,
let me know what's on your mind.

105
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,383
( beep )

106
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,726
JACKSON:
I'll let you know
what's on my mind, bud.

107
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,264
Pick up that phone
and talk to me.

108
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,334
I got no mind for machines.

109
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,236
Oh, damn,
I guess you aren't there!

110
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,663
This is your...

111
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,038
This is Harry Jackson.

112
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,972
The-the clerk
from the general store

113
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,340
brung me up a note
with this phone number.

114
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,037
He says you're comin'
to visit me.

115
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,345
Axminster!

116
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,439
JACKSON:
And I just want to say...

117
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:05,908
don't come.

118
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,383
I'm busy.

119
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,684
Ah, hell, you're probably
on the way here already.

120
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,616
You can phone the general store
again.

121
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,594
It's area code 303, triple-five,
double-seven-oh-two.

122
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,558
I'll try and run
that down right away.

123
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,753
MacGYVER:
What a beautiful part
of the world.

124
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,117
Has everything but people.

125
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,227
I got to wonder what happened
to my grandfather

126
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,027
that made him decide to live
in such isolation.

127
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:57,659
Actually, I wonder

128
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,635
if he'll even be here
to meet me.

129
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,338
WOMAN:
There he is...

130
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,805
WOMAN:
Well, hop in.

131
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,881
Hi, Harry.

132
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,882
How'd you know?

133
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,851
I never forget
a grandfather.

134
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,456
You've grown.

135
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,257
Well, it's been, what, six,
17, 18 years, hasn't it?

136
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,054
I hadn't noticed.

137
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,300
Didn't get my message to you.

138
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,163
I tried to head you off.

139
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,661
You mind that I came?

140
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,235
( bird squawking )

141
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,171
Ah, what the hell.
You're here.

142
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:40,668
Well, come on.

143
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,713
I want to get home before dark.

144
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,245
Headlights don't work.

145
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,242
You haven't changed.

146
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,346
Haven't had to,
and I don't plan to.

147
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,407
All Right.

148
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,606
( seagull cawing )

149
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,733
All right.

150
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,004
Okay.

151
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,443
Thanks a lot.

152
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,707
The number's a general store

153
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,375
in a little town
in Colorado-- Ouray.

154
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,918
Harry Jackson
doesn't have a phone,

155
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,053
but they know him, Axminster.

156
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,553
They know where he lives.

157
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,669
( truck thudding )

158
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,704
You trying to throw me
or just scare me?

159
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,473
You always did
like to talk.

160
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,200
Still tough as a dirty boot,
aren't you?

161
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,744
You're damn right.

162
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,297
( door squeaking and closing )

163
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,235
Well?

164
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,430
Black, hot and strong, right?

165
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,108
Nothin' wrong
with your memory, bud.

166
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,577
Grandma used to say

167
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,770
you'd never drink a cup
of coffee

168
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,006
unless a spoon would stand up
in it.

169
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,617
Grandma never did
give up trying
to civilize me.

170
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,211
I guess maybe

171
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,550
that was the only
dumb mistake
she ever did make.

172
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,619
Except maybe dyin'.

173
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,455
Is that why you left us?

174
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,491
You always did get right
to the point.

175
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,462
Haven't changed.

176
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,500
Not much.

177
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,334
Want coffee?

178
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,503
Yeah.

179
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,909
You didn't answer me.

180
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,508
I left...

181
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,014
because it was time to leave.

182
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,782
No, when Dad died,
you were there.

183
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,413
I mean, you were...
you were there.

184
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,491
I stayed around

185
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,148
for a while.

186
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,351
God, for the love of Mike, boy,

187
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,825
I still had the right
to my own life!

188
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,289
Doggone it, Harry,

189
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,364
I guess maybe it's...
how you did it.

190
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,163
I wake up one morning,
and you're gone.

191
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,469
I never liked good-byes.

192
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,301
I

193
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,271
took a job workin'

194
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,842
in construction up in Alaska.

195
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,203
Good job.

196
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:00,777
New country.

197
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,042
So I went.

198
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,810
I figured sending money regular
would be more use

199
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,581
to you and your mother
than I was.

200
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:10,848
You figured wrong.

201
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:15,382
That's your bunk.

202
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,859
Leave or stay, it's up to you.

203
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,637
We're ready
to roll, Axminster.

204
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,781
( engines starting )

205
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,123
How do you want
this guy MacGyver?

206
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,987
Dead or alive?

207
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:49,690
Dead.

208
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,646
( birds singing )

209
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,299
It's good.

210
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,565
Now, why are you here?

211
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,776
I guess I just got past
puttin' off this visit.

212
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,645
I haven't thought
about family in years.

213
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,955
Don't really want to now.

214
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,957
Harry, were you always
this hard-nosed?

215
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,551
Even when I was a kid?

216
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,592
( sighs )

217
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,803
I remember this.

218
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,197
JACKSON:
Uh...

219
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,741
Didn't I make this for you
when I was about ten?

220
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,539
For your birthday or something?

221
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,544
( quacking )

222
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,171
It works good, too.

223
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,981
Best I ever had.

224
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,353
CARSON:
Cabin's at the top
of the ridge, Axminster.

225
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,789
Then spread out.

226
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,621
We'll surround the
cabin and hit 'em.

227
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,091
So, you ready for some fishin'?

228
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,162
I already been.

229
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,532
What do you think
we're havin'
for breakfast?

230
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,830
Come on, Harry.

231
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,363
You're the one
that used to tell me

232
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,600
you don't fish for fish,
you fish for fishin'.

233
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,503
CARSON:
Cabin's empty,
Axminster!

234
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,074
( birds singing )

235
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,613
Nice.

236
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,439
Yeah, it's real nice.

237
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,018
Found this place
about eight years ago.

238
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,081
I'm stayin' right here
till I die.

239
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,121
Ah, you're too
mean to die.

240
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,354
What goes around comes around.

241
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,962
BLACK:
The truck's still
here, Axminster.

242
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,365
They got
to be close.

243
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,738
You know, I think Mom
and I missed you most

244
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,209
around Thanksgiving, Christmas.

245
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,007
I remember you used
to take me out
to cut a tree.

246
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,481
Stop riding it!

247
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,640
Is my being here

248
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,776
that hard on you?

249
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,218
Bud,

250
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,646
subject is closed.

251
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,206
( fishing line creaking )

252
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,535
I got one.

253
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,208
I got one!

254
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,576
JACKSON:
I said drag, bud. Watch it.

255
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,275
Ah, that's a beaut!

256
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,579
That's for dinner.

257
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,811
Don't let loose of him.

258
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,714
I'm not gonna let loose of him.

259
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,079
Get the net, Harry.

260
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:42,723
( gunshot )

261
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,453
Hey, what the...?

262
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,551
( gunshots )

263
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,625
Aah!

264
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,199
( gunshots )

265
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,601
What the hell is goin' on?

266
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,176
I'll tell you
later. Come on.

267
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,276
Who are your friends?

268
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,073
Harry, I didn't think
they'd find me here.

269
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,774
They'll probably be
down here in a minute.

270
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,216
Let's go!

271
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,958
JACKSON:
Hollow reeds?

272
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,859
MacGYVER:
Yeah. We'll make 'em think

273
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,560
we're still out there
in the water.

274
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,830
They're too smart
for that one, boy.

275
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,568
Got to try something.

276
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,039
What if they do fall
for this stunt of yours, bud?

277
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,370
What do we get out of it?

278
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,978
Buy a little distance.

279
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,809
All depends on them
believin' that it's us

280
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,781
breathin'
under these reeds.

281
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,851
Have a little faith, Harry.

282
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,270
AXMINSTER:
Where the hell are they?

283
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,042
Down there,
those reeds!

284
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,207
Fire!

285
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:16,954
( rapid gunfire )

286
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,920
You, check it out.

287
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:27,662
They tricked us.

288
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,165
What are you
talking about?

289
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,700
MacGyver set us up.

290
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,064
Let's go tell Axminster.

291
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,441
Guess your friends
found those reeds

292
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:43,946
over on the other
side of the lake.

293
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,208
See, your grandson's got
something on the ball.

294
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,649
Hold it, Harry.

295
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,051
It's a plant from
the Urtica family.

296
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,158
Strong stuff.

297
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,455
One dab in the bloodstream
hits the neural system

298
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,052
and a guy's out for hours.

299
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,290
Blow gun?

300
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:02,829
I was thinking
along those lines.

301
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:03,796
Ah.

302
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,414
The only problem
we got, Harry,

303
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,378
in order for me
to knock them out,

304
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,956
I'm gonna have
to hit them just right.

305
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,418
Right in the neck.

306
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,586
What if you miss?

307
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,227
Okay, here we go.

308
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,092
HARRY:
Now we got a blow gun,

309
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,194
maybe help to make kind of
a trail for them to track us.

310
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,376
BLACK:
Hold it.

311
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,277
Their trail
leads down to the stream.

312
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,090
Hey, what's the matter?

313
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,063
Hey, hey, what's...?

314
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,498
( grunting )

315
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,268
( yells )

316
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,214
Nice.

317
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,350
Gotta hit them
just right.

318
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,045
Harry, can we get
out this way?

319
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,619
Don't seem to have
a lot of choice.

320
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:05,655
No.

321
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,195
Hold it!

322
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,666
Hold it
right there, bud.

323
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,798
Will you stop?

324
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,440
Now wait a minute!

325
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,334
I said hold it
right there!

326
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,779
Who are you, bud?

327
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,038
Now what the devil's
all this about?

328
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,517
I ain't moving
until I get an answer.

329
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:38,782
I'm sorry, Harry.

330
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,016
I shouldn't have come.

331
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,950
I underestimated
some things.

332
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,585
Just answer the question.

333
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:47,255
It has to do

334
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,925
with freedom
and peace, Harry.

335
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,531
And some people
who don't like either.

336
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,342
Well, I sure hope

337
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,604
it's worth losing
that damn trout.

338
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,610
They're still
alive, Axminster.

339
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,482
Shall we
pick them up?

340
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,485
AXMINSTER:
Forget them.

341
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:11,816
Move it.

342
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,083
We got a job to do.

343
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,492
Is there a ranger
station around?

344
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,560
How about
a fire lookout,

345
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,930
a ranch, anything?

346
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,233
Ah, let's see.

347
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,635
Evermore, uh,
it's a little,

348
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,367
old nothing town,
uh, half dead.

349
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,204
Well, now they got
a phone line.

350
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,242
How far is it?

351
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,209
Oh, it's ten to 12 miles.

352
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,571
It's up in
the high desert.

353
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:37,804
All right.
Let's move.

354
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,018
AXMINSTER:
Go that way.

355
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,451
We'll swing around
the hill and meet you.

356
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,613
CARSON:
Right.

357
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,650
HARRY:
Haven't done this much running

358
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,127
since two winters ago when
a grizzly was chasing me.

359
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:53,855
Did he
catch you?

360
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,228
HARRY:
Nah, got tired trying
to catch an old buzzard.

361
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:57,927
Hey, what are
you doing now?

362
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,331
Stop to collect
rocks?

363
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,502
CARSON:
Maybe up that way.

364
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,778
AXMINSTER:
Okay, we'll flush them out.

365
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:10,739
See anything?

366
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,576
MacGYVER:
Oh, I see a lot of things.

367
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,443
Anything I'd be
interested in?

368
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,853
Yeah.
Two jeeps splitting up.

369
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,181
Only one's
heading our way,

370
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:19,984
but he's gonna be

371
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,355
a while getting here, so I
figure we got a little time.

372
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:23,616
To do what?

373
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,724
Harry, don't you remember
teaching me all about decoys?

374
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,031
Why don't you fill
that up with branches?

375
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,536
Oh, yeah, and make it
look like a man.

376
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,368
Now let's see if I can get
this tree to do a few tricks.

377
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,482
AXMINSTER:
No sign of them coming this way.

378
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,885
CARSON:
Should I keep going?

379
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,582
AXMINSTER:
We should figure out MacGyver.

380
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,422
Then make a decision.

381
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,429
Alpha,
Colin, Baker,

382
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,464
do you read?

383
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,462
This is Axminster.

384
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,659
Are targets in sight?

385
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:04,931
No, sir.

386
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,129
No problem, it's just a little
cat and mouse. Keep moving.

387
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,297
You got your orders.
Over and out.

388
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,036
Okay?

389
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,076
Head up
to high ground.

390
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,275
AXMINSTER:
Yeah, it's a nice day
for hunting.

391
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,998
Hey, Harry?

392
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,159
Remember you used
to tell me about

393
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,533
how the Indians fought this way?

394
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,401
Bud...

395
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,106
a lot of
that stuff

396
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,977
I used to tell you
is, uh, is stories.

397
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,315
Yeah, well, a lot
of it works, Harry.

398
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,484
( Jeep approaching )

399
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:10,626
( yelling )

400
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:15,962
Damn.

401
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:19,106
Thought we'd at least get
a free ride out of this.

402
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,609
Guess we keep
on running.

403
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,411
MacGYVER:
That's Axminster.
Let's get going.

404
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,360
BLACK:
Axminster, the other jeep,
down in the gully.

405
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,629
AXMINSTER:
Two more down.

406
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,534
Let's finish this MacGyver now.

407
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,506
You getting lightheaded, bud?

408
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,544
Pinecones?

409
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,417
Sure, Harry.

410
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,414
Don't you remember ever
throwing one in a fire?

411
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,853
What happens?

412
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,221
It kind of explodes.

413
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,826
Yeah, that's right.

414
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,954
Add a little pine pitch and you
got the makings of a landmine.

415
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,694
Ain't Mother
Nature grand?

416
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:31,945
HARRY:
You just trying
to stay above them

417
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,348
or you got some
kind of an idea?

418
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,714
A little of both.

419
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:37,982
No, I can manage!

420
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,397
Hold it, Harry.

421
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,167
I figure the Jeep'll
come from there

422
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:54,899
right through here.

423
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,438
Well, what
in the...?

424
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,844
Time to bury the landmine.

425
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,014
HARRY:
See something?

426
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,143
MacGYVER:
Nope, but
I hear something.

427
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:19,887
HARRY:
Ought to get
a move on.

428
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,898
Ah, there's plenty of time.

429
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,666
You sure that'll work?

430
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,125
Nope.

431
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,666
Bud, you are a comfort.

432
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,601
HARRY:
Here they come.

433
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,544
Come on, let's go.

434
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:45,947
When I was a kid,
I used to chew

435
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,082
pine pitch like it was gum.

436
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:52,490
It tasted all right,
but it burned a lot better.

437
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,435
All right.

438
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,568
( rapid gunfire )

439
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:16,413
( grunting )

440
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,115
Harry?

441
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:20,990
I'm all right.

442
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,653
Get him!

443
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,758
( yelling )

444
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,396
Come on, Harry,
let's get moving.

445
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,838
AXMINSTER:
Can anybody still move?

446
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,835
CARSON:
Yeah, good enough
to find MacGyver.

447
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,535
BLACK:
Looks like we're
walking now, too.

448
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,640
AXMINSTER:
Not walk, run.

449
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,445
We'll run him right
into the ground.

450
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,759
Well, that's okay.

451
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,426
I'm just dinged.

452
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,088
Yeah,
so I noticed.

453
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,801
Just grazed
you, Harry.

454
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,230
Could've been
worse, you know.

455
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:10,331
Eh, hurts like worse.

456
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,341
Put that inside.

457
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,944
Put pressure on it.

458
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,279
You all right?

459
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:33,996
We made it.

460
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,161
Yeah.

461
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,333
HARRY:
Hey!

462
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,505
MacGYVER:
So... this
is Evermore.

463
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,741
( coughs )

464
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:49,369
Harry, when was the last
time you were here?

465
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,910
Too long ago.

466
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:55,484
It's dead.

467
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,450
I guess we are, too.

468
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,920
Harry? Harry! Harry!

469
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:12,226
Damn you, Axminster.

470
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:22,543
So, there we were
in a ghost town, Harry and me.

471
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,216
I tried to make him
as comfortable as possible.

472
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,988
What are you trying, bud?

473
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,820
That's fool's gold.

474
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:34,815
Which contains

475
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:37,656
pyrite-- iron sulfide.

476
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,294
Mixing it up
with a little clay here

477
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,059
kind of makes
a natural antibiotic.

478
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,095
Let's see
what you got here.

479
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,934
Just what is it
that you do, bud?

480
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,706
Well, a little of this,
a little of that.

481
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,876
( groans softly )

482
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:04,814
Well, that... that
sure explains it.

483
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,049
You're going
to be okay, Harry.

484
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,284
Ever think of
hanging out a shingle

485
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,326
as a medicine man?

486
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,736
I've got something
to say.

487
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,137
I've avoided you.

488
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,976
You know why?

489
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,443
Mom.

490
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,907
First your grandmother.

491
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,116
Then your mom.

492
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:42,115
When the good
Lord took them,

493
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:44,727
I hurt.

494
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,089
I didn't want to be reminded,

495
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:54,138
so I just, uh,
I just kept moving.

496
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,032
Seeing you...

497
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,610
I've missed you, bud.

498
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,874
Something terrible.

499
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,243
( softly ):
Harry...

500
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,584
( sighing )

501
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:19,157
Well, that... sure
was a sorry sight.

502
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,127
( sniffling )

503
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,323
Hey.

504
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:22,790
Don't you

505
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,460
ever badmouth my grandpa,
you hear?

506
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,194
( chuckling )

507
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,862
( groaning )

508
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,139
Look, I'm going
to try and find some things

509
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:32,300
for us to fight with.

510
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,741
What do you say?

511
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,583
You really think they're going
to find us here?

512
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,819
They're professionals, Harry.

513
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,684
They'll find us.

514
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,098
Harry had a good night's rest,
but I didn't sleep at all.

515
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,236
I knew that, with first light,

516
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,329
Axminster
would be tracking us again.

517
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,410
So, I had to build
the best defense I could

518
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,273
before they got to us.

519
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:14,982
Hey, bud!

520
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,886
Mind telling me
what you're doing?

521
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,784
Yeah, found some grain dust.

522
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:19,915
Treat it right,

523
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,254
we got the makings
of a pretty good bomb,

524
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,418
I'll betcha.

525
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,585
Might work good.

526
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,195
Got a little
parlor trick

527
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,322
to get them to come up close
to where the explosion happens.

528
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,663
Sometimes you hear
about floating grain dust

529
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,205
exploding inside a silo.

530
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,639
It's called
spontaneous combustion.

531
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,702
I'm going to do it on purpose.

532
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,339
And I found
a real handy partner in Harry.

533
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,650
He seemed to be talking
just the way I was.

534
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,519
Or maybe I'd been thinking
like him all along.

535
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,644
HARRY:
Only get one shot

536
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,190
with your exploding gadget,
bud.

537
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,182
MacCGYVER:
What you got in mind, Harry?

538
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,985
HARRY:
A little
remote control distraction.

539
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,590
Guaranteed to get them galoots

540
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,724
to come up real close
for the big surprise.

541
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,826
Hey, bud, I can play magician
from over here!

542
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,132
Now you see it, now you don't--
and boom!

543
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,341
All right, that's enough.

544
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:22,009
It's shaking,

545
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,643
and I don't want it
falling on my head.

546
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,846
Real trick's going
to be

547
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,388
getting those galoots
in position.

548
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,354
MacGYVER:
If they aren't

549
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,823
right underneath it,
it won't work.

550
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,722
Where are you going?

551
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:30,555
HARRY:
Come on.

552
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,151
I got a trick
of my own.

553
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,889
What do you got,
pine nuts?

554
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,262
HARRY:
Yeah, I used
to have fun with them

555
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,995
when I was a kid.

556
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:39,933
I'd, uh, drop them in the fire,

557
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,335
and watch everybody jump,
and they'd crack,

558
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:45,406
and they'd go off like gunshots.

559
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:47,639
Well, they've
been falling

560
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,541
for your foolishness.

561
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,876
I figured
I'd try some of my own.

562
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,516
I think Harry was beginning
to enjoy the game.

563
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,987
And that's all the time we had.

564
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,574
( clanking )

565
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,522
( men yelling )

566
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,380
( loud popping )

567
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,646
( loud popping )

568
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,824
( man grunts )

569
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,857
Got him good.

570
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,266
Yeah.

571
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,816
We still have Axminster.

572
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,349
Only this time,
we got the odds.

573
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,213
Yeah.

574
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,460
Ow!

575
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,724
( grunting )

576
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:57,701
( gun cocking )

577
00:43:58,602 --> 00:43:59,967
( gunshot )

578
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,074
Try, try to move him over, bud.

579
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,904
( grunting )

580
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,282
Now, bud!

581
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,415
( yelling )

582
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,554
You all right, bud?

583
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,227
I'm more than all right, Harry.

584
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,929
( groans )

585
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,495
Whew!

586
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,670
( both laugh )

587
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,069
You figuring
on coming back this way?

588
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,305
Count on it.

589
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,547
I'll look forward to it.

590
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:47,714
Me, too.

591
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:09,934
Hey, Harry...

592
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,909
catch that big old trout,
will you?

593
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,472
Count on it.

594
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,408
Take care
of yourself, bud.

595
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,380
( theme music playing )
